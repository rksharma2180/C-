Coding standards are set of guidelines, best practic, programming styles and
     convetions that developers follow when writing source code for a project.

        Reasonable variable name - While declaring a variable the developer has to give the variable 
           a proper name. The name of the variable should be based on its use.

        Proper function name - A function should be given a name based on the functionality it does
            in the code program.
     
        Comments -  Use comments outside the function to state what this function does.
                    Write comments inside function about its logic.
        
        Developer Notes - On the top of the class the developer can mention the use of a class, date
            of creation and basic information.
                
        Different styles of commenting
        Single-line comments - //comment text
        Multiline comments - /*
                                Multiline comments  
                              */
        XML Documentation Comments - 
        /// <summary>
                comments
        ///</summary>   
         
Naming Conventions
        For class name we should pascal casing meaning class ProgramFirst and nouns 
        Same thing goes with method names CalculatePercentage
        CamelCase for arguments Main(String argsOfString) same goes for local variables
        Do not use number at the start of the variable name
        use userControl insteed of userCtrl
        
        Avoid
        String myName;
        Int32 age;
        Boolean isSaved;
        
        Correct
        string myName;
        int age;
        bool isSaved;
