A method is code block that contains a series of statements. A program causes the statements to be 
executed by calling the method and specifying any required method arguments. In C# every executed instruction
is performed in the context of a method. The main method is the entry point for every C# applicatioon and 
it is called by the common language runtime(CLR) when the program is started.
