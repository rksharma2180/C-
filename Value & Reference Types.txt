Value Vs Reference Types
	Value Type -  As the name suggests is a data type which when declared and assigned a value, holds the value directly on its own memory space.
		The value type uses a heap to store the value.
		value types data types are int, float, long, double, char, bool, decimal double etc.
	
	Reference Type in detail - Reference type a variable type which instead of storing the value in memory directly, stores the memory location
		of the actual data.
		The variable here stores the memory reference of the data and not the data directly.
		Reference data types are strings, Array etc
		When we copy this reference type of the data type it will just copy the memory address of the data so we will then have two variable
		pointing to the same data.
